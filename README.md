# Public Resource License
## This license uses the seeds in which they themselves have sown.
This is not part of the license. Only between license \[begin and end\] shall designate the license.

```GitResearch will temporarily include GitHub and GitLab until 7/19/23.


Anyone wishing to help may do so.

Corporations have successfully used all terms in a court
of law. The government has also utilized terms and tactics used
within this document. This document took two and half years to form
due to the complex nature of the situation. 

I implore you to read or listen to this article:
https://medium.com/p/4bc83666155

This document holds all humans and others alike free from a lawsuit
so long as they attribute credit and do not steal credit or try
to makeshift onto other decentralized platforms.

This document describes how no organization, human, board,
or Entity will own or control this. All workings will be public
and voted on publicly using crypto governance.

The idea may appear contradictory but is the utmost 
representation of decentralization. GitResearch is a Centralized
Decentralized Entity Organized by All Humans under one unified
platform. No boards. No directors. No leaders. No authoritarians.

The human collective.

Corporations will attempt to gaslight you. What human would be
against the acceleration of human advancement and wellbeing?

Use the Public Resource License. It's made for humans.

This license is not made to benefit any of the ultra-rich.
This license uses the seeds which they have sown.
```
### Watch out for gaslighting.
```
Here is what they will say about this license. That it is not
valid, that is it improper. That is illegal. None of which are
true. They will try to convince you or will be someone with
interests against this license within the court system that
will state that this will not work. They will have immediate
upvotes from the other bots. Humans believe congruity to mean
fact, and that is false.

The most significant fact: even if a license or contract is invalid or
unlawful, it still requires one to go to court.

Since each human is a licensor and licensee, they are bound by
the decisions of the jurisdiction of their contract, which in
this case is all jurisdictions, and since the contract may not
be universally canceled except by that of the upper court systems.
Additionally, each license/contract (yes, both) is formed between
two parties non-exclusively; and if 20 people contributed to the
repo of the research, and 40,000,000 people downloaded it, viewed it,
etc. then this would create 800,000,000 (800 million) unique pairs,
which would create 154,400,000,000,000 total headaches to try and
fight. 

The public resource license, if compared only to GitHub, would make
cause 7.15956574536e+47.

The only entities able to be sued are the ones that violate this 
license. This license restricts corporations with revenues above $100 Million from using any research unless they allow the use of their
patents and study or pay a fee to the authors.

Original authors will be credited with the  ownership of the
repository, so stealing work is useless. 

The speed of light, its method of instant communication, and all
of my research, including the fix to mathematics are protected under
all humans as they own the Public Resource License. 

But the point is. Even if invalid. A single project would need a considerable
blanket to invalidate 154,400,000,000,000 licenses. And doing so would
have precautions since this contract was based on the collective
summaries of all "FAIR BUSINESS PRACTICE" acts.

The facts. Verbal contracts are indisputable. No language is needed to 
establish a contract. A contract is excellent to have so you don't
become liable to someone else and vice versa. Contracts usually
self-terminate themselves if something minimal occurs, which
causes it to void the entire thing. This clause is to protect
the party involved that wrote the contract.

Contracts can designate any number of jurisdictions. It is unwise
to do so because then you'd have to fight in every jurisdiction to
change all jurisdictions. In this case, though, it is very desirable for the
contract or license to remain active throughout if one has a ruling 
that voids the license. The great thing about this, though, is that
every single assignment, while connected, is separate from all others,
and so, to void all of them, then the supreme court would need to
find the definitions of this contract (which are currently used to
privatize code, medicine, techniques, and all assets which
should be and originally illegal to own) illegal for all contracts
and would release all descriptions fitting patents to the public
domain.

This uses a clause that Verizon used in my employment contract since
they had many different regions. And it was that if a definition does
not adhere to local jurisdictional statutes, this article may be
amended and redefined by the agreement of both parties.

So. I give you the societal virus to give humans their rights back.
Did you know all Ivy League colleges have a vast collection
of ancient artifacts and whatnot photographs, and they want
upwards of $500 to license one photo? A photo of something in the
public domain should not be copyrightable.

By this logic, I should be able to take a photo of anything and
remove the copyright. Watch people defend corporations now. The
Public Domain means the license belongs to YOU. And the fact that
corporations can append their right onto your property should 
ANGER YOU! If it doesn't, I am confident that
you've sold out your fellow human species for a buck. Congrats. 

It should NOT cost a mother $50,000 per month to keep her SON alive. 

### The License
https://github.com/PublicResourceLicense/PublicResourceLicense/blob/main/prl%20license.txt

```PURPOSE OF THE PUBLIC RESOURCE LICENSE:

1. STUDENT INVENTIONS ARE PATENTED BY UNIVERSITIES BECAUSE THOSE
UNIVERSITIES  STATE  THAT  THEY ALLOWED THE STUDENT TO USE THEIR
FACILITIES WHICH RESULTED IN  THE   INVENTION. I  ARGUE STUDENTS
PAID FOR THOSE FACILITIES AND THE UNIVERSITIES  HAVE NO RIGHT TO
PATENT  THEIR STUDENTS WORK.  HOW  IS THAT SET  UP  FOR SUCCESS?
ALSO.  THE  GOVERNMENT  CANNOT  PATENT,   AND THE  GOVERNMENT IS
RESPONSIBLE  FOR MUCH  OF   THE FINANCING  AND FUNDING   FOR ALL
UNIVERSITIES.

2.  MANY  CORPORATIONS   HAVE  BEEN PATENTING SOFTWARE INVOLVING
EVERY FUNCTION OF SOFTWARE AND  HAVE CURRENTLY BEEN GRANTED OVER
500,000  PATENTS  DESPITE   WIPO'S   POLICY   AGAINST  PATENTING
SOFTWARE. THESE CORPORATIONS ARE ALSO TARGETING OPEN SOURCE.

3. DRUGS, PRESCRIPTIONS,  MEDICAL    METHODS, LANGUAGES,  FONTS,
ARTIFACTS,    LIFE,   TECHNICAL   METHODS,  SOFTWARE,  LANGUAGE,
FUNCTIONS, EXPRESSIONS, FORMULAS,  COMPOUNDS, ELEMENTS,  MEDICAL
TECHNIQUES, AND THOSE ALIKE WERE  SUPPOSED TO BE RESTRICTED FROM
PATENTS,  COPYRIGHT, WITH SOME RESTRICTED  FROM TRADEMARKS. THIS
HAS  NOT  BEEN THE  CASE.   SINCE  ALL  THE ABOVE   CAN BE UNDER
CONTRACT, LICENSE, AND PATENTS, THIS LICENSE SHALL  REMAIN VALID
UNTIL  ALL OF THOSE ARE   PUT  INTO THE  PUBLIC   DOMAIN WITH NO
FURTHER COPYRIGHT OR PATENT ELIGIBILITY.

4. THE RESTRICTION  OF   RESEARCH MUST BE ELIMINATED.  THE ROYAL
SOCIETY  AND  THEIR INSTITUTIONS SHALL  NO LONGER HAVE ANY RIGHT
OVER  IT. THE COLLECTIVENESS OF   HUMANS  EVALUATING  EACH OTHER
BASED ON A  NEW   SCIENTIFIC METHOD BY GITRESEARCH   SHALL ALLOW
CONGRUITY   IN  THE COMMUNITY.  50K   HUMANS  WITHOUT  A COLLEGE
EDUCATION WILL BE ABLE  TO ADVANCE DECADES PASSED   500K COLLEGE
GRADUATES IN A MATTER OF YEARS COMPARED TO THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD
WHICH  CAN TAKE UP  TO  THREE MONTHS FOR EVALUATION. SCIENCE AND
RESEARCH SHOULD BE RELEASED THE DAY OF FOR REVIEW OF THE PUBLIC.
REFUTATIONS WOULD BE CLOSED UNTIL RESEARCH CONCLUDES.

5. RESEARCHERS ARE BECOMING FATIGUED WITH THE OVER-PROPERNESS OF
HAVING  TO  WRITE CRYPTIC  PAPERS  IN A LANGUAGE NO ONE LIKES TO
READ. FUCK IT. STOP BEING  OFFENDED  BECAUSE THE QUEEN  DOES NOT
LIKE YOUR LANGUAGE. WHILE HALF OF  THE RULES  WILL BE KEPT. MUCH
OF   IT WILL BE  MUCH   MORE LENIENT. DATA WILL ALSO   GO INTO A
DIFFERENT SECTION FOR EASY ACCESS.

6. RESEARCH WILL AUTOMATICALLY PULL  CITATIONS FROM  THE CENTRAL
DATABASE.  RESEARCHERS THAT  RECEIVE PUBLIC  ACCEPTANCE  WILL BE
AWARDED  THEIR  $TAG  TO   PULL   THEIR  DISCOVERY   OR RESEARCH
DEVELOPMENT.

7.  NO COMMITTEE, OR GATEKEEPERS, OR  LEADERS, OR APPROVERS WILL
BE A PART OF  GITRESEARCH.  THIS PROJECT SHALL  ALLOW  HUMANS TO
GOVERN VIA CONSENSUS.

8. NO HUMAN SHALL BE EXCLUDED FROM CONTRIBUTION.

9. THE OPEN SOURCE OF SOFTWARE   DEVELOPMENT  HAS PROVEN  A HUGE
SUCCESS. CRYPTOCURRENCY WHICH IS AN OPEN-SOURCE PROJECT IS WORTH
NEARLY  TWO TRILLION DOLLARS.  MORESO THAN ANY   OTHER SOFTWARE.
