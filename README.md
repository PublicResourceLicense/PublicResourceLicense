```GitResearch will temporarily include GitHub and GitLab until 7/19/23.

Anyone wishing to help may do so.

All terms used have been used by corporations successfully in a court
of law. The government has also utilized terms and tactics used
within this document. This document took two and half years to form
due to the complex nature of the situation. 

I implore you to read or listen to this article:

This documents holds all humans and others alike free from lawsuit
so long as they attribute credit, and do not steal credit nor try
to make shift onto other decentralized platforms.

The idea may appear contradictory but is in fact the utmost 
representation of decentralization. GitResearch is a Centralized
Decentralized Entity Organized by All Humans under one unified
platform. No boards. No directors. No leaders. No authoritarians.

The human collective.

Corporations will attempt to gaslight you. What human would be
against the acceleration of human advancement and wellbeing?

Use the Public Resource License. It's made for humans.

This license is not made to benefit any of the ultra rich.
This license uses the seeds in which they themselves have sown.

### The License
https://github.com/PublicResourceLicense/PublicResourceLicense/blob/main/prl%20license.txt

```PURPOSE OF THE PUBLIC RESOURCE LICENSE:

1. STUDENT INVENTIONS ARE PATENTED BY UNIVERSITIES BECAUSE THOSE
UNIVERSITIES  STATE  THAT  THEY ALLOWED THE STUDENT TO USE THEIR
FACILITIES WHICH RESULTED IN  THE   INVENTION. I  ARGUE STUDENTS
PAID FOR THOSE FACILITIES AND THE UNIVERSITIES  HAVE NO RIGHT TO
PATENT  THEIR STUDENTS WORK.  HOW  IS THAT SET  UP  FOR SUCCESS?
ALSO.  THE  GOVERNMENT  CANNOT  PATENT,   AND THE  GOVERNMENT IS
RESPONSIBLE  FOR MUCH  OF   THE FINANCING  AND FUNDING   FOR ALL
UNIVERSITIES.

2.  MANY  CORPORATIONS   HAVE  BEEN PATENTING SOFTWARE INVOLVING
EVERY FUNCTION OF SOFTWARE AND  HAVE CURRENTLY BEEN GRANTED OVER
500,000  PATENTS  DESPITE   WIPO'S   POLICY   AGAINST  PATENTING
SOFTWARE. THESE CORPORATIONS ARE ALSO TARGETING OPEN SOURCE.

3. DRUGS, PRESCRIPTIONS,  MEDICAL    METHODS, LANGUAGES,  FONTS,
ARTIFACTS,    LIFE,   TECHNICAL   METHODS,  SOFTWARE,  LANGUAGE,
FUNCTIONS, EXPRESSIONS, FORMULAS,  COMPOUNDS, ELEMENTS,  MEDICAL
TECHNIQUES, AND THOSE ALIKE WERE  SUPPOSED TO BE RESTRICTED FROM
PATENTS,  COPYRIGHT, WITH SOME RESTRICTED  FROM TRADEMARKS. THIS
HAS  NOT  BEEN THE  CASE.   SINCE  ALL  THE ABOVE   CAN BE UNDER
CONTRACT, LICENSE, AND PATENTS, THIS LICENSE SHALL  REMAIN VALID
UNTIL  ALL OF THOSE ARE   PUT  INTO THE  PUBLIC   DOMAIN WITH NO
FURTHER COPYRIGHT OR PATENT ELIGIBILITY.

4. THE RESTRICTION  OF   RESEARCH MUST BE ELIMINATED.  THE ROYAL
SOCIETY  AND  THEIR INSTITUTIONS SHALL  NO LONGER HAVE ANY RIGHT
OVER  IT. THE COLLECTIVENESS OF   HUMANS  EVALUATING  EACH OTHER
BASED ON A  NEW   SCIENTIFIC METHOD BY GITRESEARCH   SHALL ALLOW
CONGRUITY   IN  THE COMMUNITY.  50K   HUMANS  WITHOUT  A COLLEGE
EDUCATION WILL BE ABLE  TO ADVANCE DECADES PASSED   500K COLLEGE
GRADUATES IN A MATTER OF YEARS COMPARED TO THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD
WHICH  CAN TAKE UP  TO  THREE MONTHS FOR EVALUATION. SCIENCE AND
RESEARCH SHOULD BE RELEASED THE DAY OF FOR REVIEW OF THE PUBLIC.
REFUTATIONS WOULD BE CLOSED UNTIL RESEARCH CONCLUDES.

5. RESEARCHERS ARE BECOMING FATIGUED WITH THE OVER-PROPERNESS OF
HAVING  TO  WRITE CRYPTIC  PAPERS  IN A LANGUAGE NO ONE LIKES TO
READ. FUCK IT. STOP BEING  OFFENDED  BECAUSE THE QUEEN  DOES NOT
LIKE YOUR LANGUAGE. WHILE HALF OF  THE RULES  WILL BE KEPT. MUCH
OF   IT WILL BE  MUCH   MORE LENIENT. DATA WILL ALSO   GO INTO A
DIFFERENT SECTION FOR EASY ACCESS.

6. RESEARCH WILL AUTOMATICALLY PULL  CITATIONS FROM  THE CENTRAL
DATABASE.  RESEARCHERS THAT  RECEIVE PUBLIC  ACCEPTANCE  WILL BE
AWARDED  THEIR  $TAG  TO   PULL   THEIR  DISCOVERY   OR RESEARCH
DEVELOPMENT.

7.  NO COMMITTEE, OR GATEKEEPERS, OR  LEADERS, OR APPROVERS WILL
BE A PART OF  GITRESEARCH.  THIS PROJECT SHALL  ALLOW  HUMANS TO
GOVERN VIA CONSENSUS.

8. NO HUMAN SHALL BE EXCLUDED FROM CONTRIBUTION.

9. THE OPEN SOURCE OF SOFTWARE   DEVELOPMENT  HAS PROVEN  A HUGE
SUCCESS. CRYPTOCURRENCY WHICH IS AN OPEN-SOURCE PROJECT IS WORTH
NEARLY  TWO TRILLION DOLLARS.  MORESO THAN ANY   OTHER SOFTWARE.
