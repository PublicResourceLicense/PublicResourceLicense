# Public Resource License
## This license uses the seeds in which they themselves have sown.
This is not part of the license. Only between license \[begin and end\] shall designate the license.

Anyone wishing to help may do so.

here are a few things with universities in this contract. All (at least all I could find) universities patent their students’ inventions because “they gave them the facilities needed to invent.” That is not how that works. Students pay for universities. Under no circumstance should these organizations be able to claim the right of ownership for a student’s invention.

How is that setting them up for success? It isn’t. It is stealing.

Therefore, this license protects a student’s and faculty member’s work and prohibits any university or organization of education from patenting, trademarking, copyrighting, licensing, or having any claim of ownership over any property. All licensors must be human, and these entities cannot use a proxy.

Since open-source licenses can revert to their fully licensed version by only having a part of the license available in the code, this license shall also take advantage of that. Of course, this was not meant to be an easy fight. Corporations have pushed their way to be the law. Well. I, on behalf of human interest, authored this license to give humans a bit of freedom.

A few pointers:

No law states a contract be bulletproof.

There are many against this contract and will do anything to prevent you and others from viewing it. Make sure to make a bit of noise on any negative comment. Negative comments without provoking is a clear sign that they are threatened.

Verbal agreements are law binding.

Viewing an agreement can be law binding.

A scribble on a napkin can be an agreement if it offers consideration. Consideration is an exchange of anything from material items to promises.

It is not against any law to assign a contract to multiple jurisdictions.

Many things are not patentable, but anything is licensable.

Contracts can be redefined in court within a jurisdiction if the judge deems it unfair and a clause exists to allow both parties or the judge to choose alternative definitions.

Contracts and laws have discriminated against low-income individuals since arrangements have existed. It is no different when targeting the ultra-rich.

You can define a list in any way possible as long as the definition is within the license itself.

The supreme court mandated that licenses are identical to contracts, so we must now have consideration.

A contract/license is only void if it asks you to do something illegal.

No matter how much this contract may appear to be bullshit. It is still active in every jurisdiction individually between members, meaning that it would be impossible for corporations to fight. On the flip side, all humans can collectively sue a corporation for violating the agreement.

A contract can be entered into verbally, so a warning across research shall be sufficient for agreement.

Ignorance does not void licenses, contracts, patents, trademarks, copyrights, etc.

Restrictions: you are not allowed to use the research if it is to be used by corporations or subsidies of corporations with annual revenues of $100,000,000USD or equivalent to that amount in the local or most popular worldwide currency. Corporations over the restriction threshold can obtain permission to use the research. Funds allocated are voted on by all members of the branch. The governance shall be crypto-based so that no single person or group can hijack funds, and all allocations are public. All humans will govern it via a no-revenue organization.

Living contractual propagations: It just means that if something is illegal in that jurisdiction — as this is a worldwide license, then that part shall be redefined or removed in that jurisdiction pursuant to the overall purpose of the license and agreed to by both parties. This is one that employment contracts like to utilize.

A corporate term that has given unilateral dictatorship of all law is this simple phrase that has been upheld countless times: “we reserve the right to terminate your account for any reason at any time without notice.”

If that is not illegal, then nothing in this contract comes close to that. Since the supreme court considers a license a contract, I now combine my definition of the two.

Further restrictions: you cannot use the research to harm, oppress, track, or spy on humans.

Consideration: I have put time and effort into my research, and so I license it under the Public Resource License, which allows any human to add to the research, take the study for themselves, or to profit from it as long as it is not verbatim or sold within any educational resource as all educational resources should be free to an extent. I understand that many researchers make their living on publishing research, so they are entitled to the authorship of their contribution for up to three years.

The consideration of the license is “you are allowed to use my research,” but in exchange, “you must license all of your research and subsequent research under this same license.”

Any authorship of textbooks or physical books shall give the research owner the first couple of years to write about it in physical print.

Fairness is built on antitrust laws. Licenses must also be fair, and so, if you agree to use this research, then you agree to hold all humans unaccountable for anything that goes wrong, and we agree not to hold you accountable UNLESS the act was purposively malicious against humans or committed a crime in which property or assets were stolen.

What about News or articles?

They only need to prepend their articles/videos with: ℗ Public Resource License — Research based on this research must be licensed under the Public Resource License.

It should NOT cost a mother $50,000 per month to keep her SON alive. 

### The License
https://github.com/PublicResourceLicense/PublicResourceLicense/blob/main/prl%20license.txt

```PURPOSE OF THE PUBLIC RESOURCE LICENSE:

1. STUDENT INVENTIONS ARE PATENTED BY UNIVERSITIES BECAUSE THOSE
UNIVERSITIES  STATE  THAT  THEY ALLOWED THE STUDENT TO USE THEIR
FACILITIES WHICH RESULTED IN  THE   INVENTION. I  ARGUE STUDENTS
PAID FOR THOSE FACILITIES AND THE UNIVERSITIES  HAVE NO RIGHT TO
PATENT  THEIR STUDENTS WORK.  HOW  IS THAT SET  UP  FOR SUCCESS?
ALSO.  THE  GOVERNMENT  CANNOT  PATENT,   AND THE  GOVERNMENT IS
RESPONSIBLE  FOR MUCH  OF   THE FINANCING  AND FUNDING   FOR ALL
UNIVERSITIES.

2.  MANY  CORPORATIONS   HAVE  BEEN PATENTING SOFTWARE INVOLVING
EVERY FUNCTION OF SOFTWARE AND  HAVE CURRENTLY BEEN GRANTED OVER
500,000  PATENTS  DESPITE   WIPO'S   POLICY   AGAINST  PATENTING
SOFTWARE. THESE CORPORATIONS ARE ALSO TARGETING OPEN SOURCE.

3. DRUGS, PRESCRIPTIONS,  MEDICAL    METHODS, LANGUAGES,  FONTS,
ARTIFACTS,    LIFE,   TECHNICAL   METHODS,  SOFTWARE,  LANGUAGE,
FUNCTIONS, EXPRESSIONS, FORMULAS,  COMPOUNDS, ELEMENTS,  MEDICAL
TECHNIQUES, AND THOSE ALIKE WERE  SUPPOSED TO BE RESTRICTED FROM
PATENTS,  COPYRIGHT, WITH SOME RESTRICTED  FROM TRADEMARKS. THIS
HAS  NOT  BEEN THE  CASE.   SINCE  ALL  THE ABOVE   CAN BE UNDER
CONTRACT, LICENSE, AND PATENTS, THIS LICENSE SHALL  REMAIN VALID
UNTIL  ALL OF THOSE ARE   PUT  INTO THE  PUBLIC   DOMAIN WITH NO
FURTHER COPYRIGHT OR PATENT ELIGIBILITY.

4. THE RESTRICTION  OF   RESEARCH MUST BE ELIMINATED.  THE ROYAL
SOCIETY  AND  THEIR INSTITUTIONS SHALL  NO LONGER HAVE ANY RIGHT
OVER  IT. THE COLLECTIVENESS OF   HUMANS  EVALUATING  EACH OTHER
BASED ON A  NEW   SCIENTIFIC METHOD BY GITRESEARCH   SHALL ALLOW
CONGRUITY   IN  THE COMMUNITY.  50K   HUMANS  WITHOUT  A COLLEGE
EDUCATION WILL BE ABLE  TO ADVANCE DECADES PASSED   500K COLLEGE
GRADUATES IN A MATTER OF YEARS COMPARED TO THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD
WHICH  CAN TAKE UP  TO  THREE MONTHS FOR EVALUATION. SCIENCE AND
RESEARCH SHOULD BE RELEASED THE DAY OF FOR REVIEW OF THE PUBLIC.
REFUTATIONS WOULD BE CLOSED UNTIL RESEARCH CONCLUDES.

5. RESEARCHERS ARE BECOMING FATIGUED WITH THE OVER-PROPERNESS OF
HAVING  TO  WRITE CRYPTIC  PAPERS  IN A LANGUAGE NO ONE LIKES TO
READ. FUCK IT. STOP BEING  OFFENDED  BECAUSE THE QUEEN  DOES NOT
LIKE YOUR LANGUAGE. WHILE HALF OF  THE RULES  WILL BE KEPT. MUCH
OF   IT WILL BE  MUCH   MORE LENIENT. DATA WILL ALSO   GO INTO A
DIFFERENT SECTION FOR EASY ACCESS.

6. RESEARCH WILL AUTOMATICALLY PULL  CITATIONS FROM  THE CENTRAL
DATABASE.  RESEARCHERS THAT  RECEIVE PUBLIC  ACCEPTANCE  WILL BE
AWARDED  THEIR  $TAG  TO   PULL   THEIR  DISCOVERY   OR RESEARCH
DEVELOPMENT.

7.  NO COMMITTEE, OR GATEKEEPERS, OR  LEADERS, OR APPROVERS WILL
BE A PART OF  GITRESEARCH.  THIS PROJECT SHALL  ALLOW  HUMANS TO
GOVERN VIA CONSENSUS.

8. NO HUMAN SHALL BE EXCLUDED FROM CONTRIBUTION.

9. THE OPEN SOURCE OF SOFTWARE   DEVELOPMENT  HAS PROVEN  A HUGE
SUCCESS. CRYPTOCURRENCY WHICH IS AN OPEN-SOURCE PROJECT IS WORTH
NEARLY  TWO TRILLION DOLLARS.  MORESO THAN ANY   OTHER SOFTWARE.
