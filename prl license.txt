PUBLIC RESOURCE LICENSE


An Agreement of Open Research for All Humans

gitresearch.org

Any   license  attempting  to    copy   this  license   as their
own—plagiarize—shall have their entire work be  registered under
this  license;  the  claim  of Authorship shall be forfeited and
will become a public Authorship.

This  document is anti-monopolistic,  as it  grants  every human
born of a natural birth a level of ownership. The  simple use of
public resource Research shall activate this license.

Research is defined in the modifier section, and a proxy will be
used in its place  until that point, which  includes  all words,
definitions, and the combination thereof.

Contributor (Contribution) is synonymous or related with, and to
Author (Authorship) and Researcher (Research,) and is defined as
any human who Contributes to any Research.

This license shall be considered   as its own individual license
within every individual state, city,  and  country,  and between
each  party, and each individual instance of the above mentioned
shall have limited jurisdiction over this agreement.

This  license shall be considered as  its own individual license
between parties and cannot be voided under any blanket statement
as each region, subregion,  and sector has its  own  unique laws
which  pertain  differently   dependent on the parties involved;
thus, each license must be  tried  separately in each  region to
determine the validity.

All  licenses are connected as a  collective, but  legally shall
remain individual between  parties within their respective local
jurisdictions. Any licensee   or licensor (Researcher)  from any
area shall be granted the authority to enforce this license with
the license which connects them all.

Your  Research  must  display    the  public    resource license
disclaimer prior to revealing any  Research in any medium on any
platform.   The  Research  may  not   be  physically  copied and
distributed  for  any  sort    of consideration, whether   it be
monetary or trade, unless by the  original Author of the claimed
Research. The Research may be posted anywhere online verbatim so
long  as the branch  Authorship  is  displayed along    with the
disclaimer in front of any content.
